##### Algebraic Surfaces

I joined a research group trying to create complex algebraic surfaces in real space. We wanted to develop a program that you could feed a surface and it would find singularities and transform the surface to a 3d printable object that is as accurate as possible. Which proved to be difficult due to computing directions of plugs and sockets, thickening around the singularities, and meshes being jagged and armadillo-like.

##### Predicting Fractal Behavior

This group was specifically working with iterated function systems. We developed heuristics to apply to one iteration to find behaviors. For each iteration of the system, a variation was selected with a certain probability. The asymptotic points make up the final fractal image. In this work, we examined specific variations using various heuristics that measured behavior between iterations and reveal the system's deeper patterns that improve our understanding of the system's intrinsic behavior.

Our research focuses on developing and applying a multitude of heuristics designed to analyze the dynamic behavior of individual variations within these systems. Through visualizations produced by each heuristic, we illustrate the distinct characteristics of each heuristic across multiple variations
